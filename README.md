# My Custom FoundryVTT Macros

These macros are used in Foundry to enhance or add functionality.  
Some of the macros may require a module to be installed. If so it will be notied at the top of the macro file in a comment.

#### Modules Used By Some Macros:
- [Advanced Macros](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/fvtt-advanced-macros)

## Notes
ESLint is used to enforce code consistency (which is why there is a package.json)
